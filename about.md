	👋 Hi there, I'm <b>Jehan Yang</b>. Thank you for your interest! I am currently a PhD student working on assistive robotics at CMU. My two advisors are <a href="https://zackory.com/">Zackory Erickson</a> in the Robotics Institute and <a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/weber-douglas.html">Doug Weber</a> in Mechanical Engineering and the Neuroscience Institute.

My goal is to become a robotics researcher that advances the field by having robots safely and efficiently help humans. To achieve this goal, I have interests in physical human robot interaction, control theory, and machine learning. One day, I hope to see robots interacting seamlessly with humans. 

I received my BS at UC Berkeley in Mechanical Engineering and my MS at Caltech in Electrical Engineering. At Caltech, I worked in the [AMBER Lab](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/) with Professor [Aaron Ames](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/people.html). At UC Berkeley, I worked in the [Biomimetic Millisystems Lab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/Biomimetics.html) with Professor [Ronald S. Fearing](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/) and in the [Gu Research Group](https://gu.berkeley.edu) with Professor [Grace X. Gu](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/grace-x-gu/). In these labs, I worked on biomimetic robots, soft manipulators, and knee prosthetics.

If you are interested in my publications, I have a [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SYQvCw4AAAAJ&hl=en) that is kept up to date. 

## More About Me

I was born in Taiwan and moved to the United States when I was six years old. For high school, I went to [Douglas Anderson School of the Arts](https://dcps.duvalschools.org/anderson) in Jacksonville and also [Diamond Bar High School](https://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/) near Los Angeles.

I first learned about engineering and robotics in college at UC Berkeley, where I worked on making possible a robotics competition for underserved high schools in the Oakland/East Bay area through [Pioneers in Engineering](https://pierobotics.org). 

Since my time in Pioneers in Engineering, I have completed robotics internships at [Universal Creative](https://jobs.universalparks.com/universal-creative/), [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), [Covariant](https://covariant.ai/), [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/), and [Miso Robotics](https://misorobotics.com/). Throughout all these internships, I have found that I appreciated working on the research aspects of robotics work the best, which led me to pursue a PhD at CMU. 

My interests outside of engineering are volunteering as an EMT, improving my Mandarin, and helping URM in higher education through [Pioneers in Engineering](https://pierobotics.org). I'd really like to get more into boxing and making music, so definitely feel free to reach out and talk if you have similar interests and/or you're in the area!
